# 2022_AdiversityMetric
Experiments from the paper "A diversity metric for population-based metaheuristic algorithms", published in 2022.
The files were created with Matlab, and all the experiments of the paper are included. The main file is runBenchmark.m, which runs a generic test. 
The experiments are separated by number, and some lines of code are commented because their original purpose was to debug the original code. 
In case of using this code, please cite the paper as:
"Valentín Osuna-Enciso, Erik Cuevas, Bernardo Morales Castañeda, A diversity metric for population-based metaheuristic algorithms, Information Sciences, Volume 586, 2022, Pages 192-208."
